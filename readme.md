## Development

### Commands

Any of the following commands can (and should :wink:) be run from the command line.

> If using [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), all instances of `npm` can be replaced with `yarn`. :ok_hand:

#### build

```
$ npm run build
```

Compiles all files. Output is sent to the `dist` directory.

#### start

```
$ npm start
```

Runs your application (from the `dist` directory) in the browser.

#### watch

```
$ npm run watch
```

Like [`start`](#start), but will auto-compile & auto-reload the server after any file changes within the `src` directory.

### Docker Support

Run all services required to develop with Vivos em Nós project.

```
docker-compose up
```

The Dockfile found in this repo is used to build [`docker image`](https://hub.docker.com/r/nossas/vivos-em-nos/).

### Dashboard

With [`webpack-dashboard`](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/webpack-dashboard), it's much easier to see what's happening inside your bundles. In addition to de-cluttering your `webpack-dev-server` log, you can quickly make sense of your bundles' `import`s and sizes.

The dashboard is meant to be interactive (scrollable). If you are having issues, please see the author's note:

> ***OS X Terminal.app users:*** Make sure that **View → Allow Mouse Reporting** is enabled, otherwise scrolling through logs and modules won't work. If your version of Terminal.app doesn't have this feature, you may want to check out an alternative such as [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/index.html).

### Preact Developer Tools

You can inspect and modify the state of your Preact UI components at runtime using the [React Developer Tools](https://github.com/facebook/react-devtools) browser extension.

1. Install the [React Developer Tools](https://github.com/facebook/react-devtools) extension
2. [Import the `preact/devtools`](src/index.js#L21) module in your app
3. Reload and go to the 'React' tab in the browser's development tools
